# ProGramer-GDSC-Solution-Challenge-2023

Welcome to our project, a game that integrates programming concepts. In this repo, we have included the game, the online compiler and a website. The compiler is built on django framework, so you'll need to have idle and django installed (pip install django) and then follow the given instructions to run the compiler : -
1 First of all install "Online-Compiler version 2" folder as it is from the repo.
2 Now right click on the folder and run it on terminal.
3 Enter the command "cd Compiler".
4 Now enter the command "python manage.py runserver".
5 Now go to your web browser and enter localhost:8000, to test out the working demo of the compiler.
6 Since this is demo, we have only included the basic print statement program test. Also as you could see the compiler is not yet hosted, which we plan to do.
